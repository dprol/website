Hey there! I'm Sam. Professionally I'm a software engineer, but I like to spend
my free time learning from all the amazing people there are to be found (both in
my own life and beyond). Here you can find some of my writings about some of my
learnings.

Feel free to either send me a message here or reach out via social media :)
