    <h1>Samuel Estep</h1>
    <h2>2015-2016 AP® Computer Science Class - Parent Information</h2>
    <p>Quick note: both the class roster and the snack signup sheet are Google
      spreadsheets, so you'll need a Google account to access them. All the
      students' moms have been given permission to view the spreadsheets; if you
      need permission on another account as well, please email me and I'll add
      that account to the spreadsheet.</p>

    <h3>Carpooling</h3>
    <p>Flexibility is important in any sort of long-term commitment, and this
      class is no exception. In order to help you work out logistics for getting
      to class and back, I have put together
      a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17uCQOg3O8GRbetAr3JLlkp8oEAGrQpvde6nB7v7icZw/edit?usp=sharing">class
      roster</a> with location and contact information for those who have given
      me permission to do so.</p>
    <p>You can use this roster to communicate and arrange carpooling with other
      families at your convenience. However, the requirement that at least one
      parent must attend the first session in the fall class and, if applicable,
      the first session in the spring class, still holds.</p>

    <h3>Payment</h3>
    <p>As stated on the registration form, you must make full payment for the
      fall class by Tuesday, August 11, 2015. The address to which payment must
      be made is listed in the confirmation email you received after you filled
      out the registration form.</p>
    <p>If your student is taking both the fall and spring classes, you can
      choose whether you would like to pay the $200 bundle price now for both
      classes, or instead pay just the $125 for the fall class now, and pay the
      $100 for the spring class before its first session in mid-January.</p>

    <h3>TeenCoder™ Purchase</h3>
    <p>For the first class session on August 18, your student will need to bring
      their laptop and all of their TeenCoder™ materials (physical textbook,
      plus all digital materials). Therefore, you must purchase TeenCoder™ as
      soon as possible so that they will have those materials before class
      starts. You can purchase
      TeenCoder™ <a href="http://www.homeschoolprogramming.com/teencoder/teencoder_jv_series.php">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Since it contains exactly the TeenCoder™ materials we will need in this
      class, I would strongly recommend purchasing the TeenCoder™: Java
      Programming Complete Course bundle, which is $75 and can be found between
      The Year Pack and TeenCoder™: Android Programming bundles on the page I've
      linked. If you would like, however, you can purchase a different bundle,
      but the bundle that you purchase must at least include the TeenCoder™:
      Java Programming Complete Course materials.</p>

    <h3>Snacks</h3>
    <p>Programmers need their snacks! We'd like to ask each family to bring
      snacks three times during the fall semester. More detailed information is
      available on
      the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WumxeNR-aYakmDFv0wjxHFMntZrrUf19UrDqONuDHlk/edit?usp=sharing">snack
      signup sheet</a>.</p>
    <p>Plan to bring snacks for at least 10 people. Nothing really fancy is
      necessary; a simple snack is perfectly fine. What exactly you bring is up
      to you, but there are some snack ideas on the spreadsheet just in
      case.</p>

    <h3>Medical Release Form</h3>
    <p>Unless you plan to stay with your student, please be sure to bring a
      completed medical release form to the first class session. (If you have
      already sent it to me, thank you!)</p>

    <h3>Inclement Weather</h3>
    <p>Please make an effort to attend every class session and to arrive a few
      minutes early so that instruction can begin promptly at 9:00 AM. If we
      have inclement weather, we will cancel by email by 7:00 AM that day and
      try to make the class up later in the week if possible. If a class is
      canceled and cannot be made up, we will electronically provide you with
      the slides and homework assignments for that week. <strong>Even if class
      is cancelled, due dates for homework assignments do not
      change.</strong></p>
    <p>If it snows, but we decide not to cancel class, there are a couple things
      to keep in mind about parking in our driveway. Only the paved part of the
      driveway will be plowed, so driving around during drop-off or pick-up may
      be tight. Finally, be sure not to drive or park near the roof if snow is
      on it; because of the solar panels, there is a very real hazard of snow
      sliding off and damaging your car or hurting someone.</p>
