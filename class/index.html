      <h2>Feedback From Last Year</h2>
      <blockquote>The graphical activities were really fun! Loved
        it.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>I liked the fact that the lab work was the focus of this
        course. It helps greatly in terms of learning.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>I really liked how small the class was and how laid back it
        was. I've had teachers who had low tolerance for adding jokes to my
        projects.</blockquote>

      <h2>General Information</h2>
      <p>This is an introductory college-level computer science course which
        follows an AP®-authorized syllabus. Students will learn to write,
        compile, and run programs
        in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>.
        Instruction and lab time are provided in weekly on-site sessions and
        homework assignments. <strong>This is not an online class.</strong> The
        fall course teaches fundamental programming concepts, basic and
        intermediate aspects of the Java language, and basic graphical
        programming, while the spring course serves as preparation for
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science">AP®
        Computer Science</a> exam.</p>
      <p>Class will meet once a week from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM on Tuesday
        mornings. The fall course will have 17 sessions; the first session will
        meet on August 18, 2015, and the last session will meet on January 5,
        2016. Class will not meet on November 24 (Thanksgiving break) or on
        December 15, 22, or 29 (Christmas break). The spring course will have 15
        sessions; the first session will meet on January 19, 2016, and the last
        session will meet on April 26, 2016.</p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>You must own and know how to use a laptop computer to take this class.
        In other words, you should be able to easily use a keyboard and mouse to
        navigate through at least the basic menus and features of your operating
        system. More importantly, you should have a firm grasp of your
        filesystem and be able to understand and remember where things are and
        how to move them around on your computer. You must have an email address
        and check your email frequently (at least once a day would be ideal).
        Knowledge of introductory algebra is strongly recommended but not
        required.</p>
      <p>Your computer should at least meet the following minimum
        requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1.6 GHz CPU</li>
        <li>1024 MB RAM</li>
        <li>1024 x 768 or higher resolution</li>
        <li>Hard drive with 3 GB free space</li>
        <li>DVD-ROM drive</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following operating systems are guaranteed to work (or if you use a
        fairly recent version of Linux, that will probably work too):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows XP + SP3 or above (except Starter Edition)</li>
        <li>Windows Vista + SP2 or above (except Starter Edition)</li>
        <li>Windows 7</li>
        <li>Windows 8 (except RT)</li>
        <li>OS X 10.5.8 or above (on Intel CPUs)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You must have consistent access to the internet to download necessary
        materials and software, receive and submit homework assignments, and
        otherwise communicate with me during the entirety of the course.</p>
      <p>At least one parent must attend the first class session in the fall
        and, if applicable, the first class session in the spring. We will give
        an overview of the course and subject matter, answer any remaining
        questions, and discuss important information related to computer
        science, AP® tests, and of course, the AP® Computer Science test, in
        these two class sessions.</p>

      <h2>Price</h2>
      <p>The fall class costs $125, and the spring class costs $100. The fall
        class is a prerequisite for the spring class. The price of the fall and
        spring classes together, if paid at the same time before the start of
        the fall class, is $200. All but $50 of total class fees is refundable
        before the fifth session of the fall class.</p>
      <p>The fall class
        uses <a href="http://www.homeschoolprogramming.com/teencoder/teencoder_jv_series.php">TeenCoder™</a>
        as a Java textbook. The cost of TeenCoder™ ($75 minimum for the Java
        Programming Complete Course) is not included in other class fees, so you
        will need to purchase it separately. The TeenCoder™ materials are
        nonconsumable; you can use them for any number of students in your
        family for as long as you wish.</p>
      <p>The spring class will use an AP® prep book as a study aid. The cost of
        a prep book (~$15) is also not included in other class fees, so you will
        need to purchase one separately. <strong>Do not buy a prep book until
        after the fall class has ended.</strong> Since the AP® Computer Science
        exam changed its format last year, prep book writers still need a chance
        to catch up, and having access to the latest and greatest prep materials
        is extremely valuable for any exam.</p>
      <p>The cost of the AP® Computer Science exam is not included in other
        class fees. If you plan to take the exam, you will need to arrange with
        and pay the $91 fee to your local high school.</p>
      <p>Registration is
        available <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/gCWptxzCzZ">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Content</h3>
      <h4>Will this class teach me to make websites?</h4>
      <p>No.</p>

      <h4>Will this class teach me to make video games?</h4>
      <p>Yes: a graphical board game.</p>

      <h4>Why Java?</h4>
      <p>While Java isn't the simplest language, it is currently very popular,
        and the way that it emphasizes object-oriented concepts makes it useful
        for teaching those concepts and enforcing best practices. The main
        reason I recommend learning Java first, though, is that it is the
        language used on the AP®.</p>

      <h3>Eligibility</h3>
      <h4>Will this class be a good fit for me?</h4>
      <p>If you meet the above requirements and you enjoy problem solving,
        learning new things, and experimenting with computers, then yes! Just
        remember that, while there are many reasons this class would be
        practical for you to take, the most important consideration is
        whether <em>you</em> want to do it.</p>

      <h4>Why would I want to take computer science in high school?</h4>
      <p>If you plan to study programming in college, starting early will of
        course give you a head start in that field. In addition, taking an
        introductory computer science course in college is considerably more
        expensive than in high school. Even if you don't plan on being a
        programmer, programming is still incredibly relevant to any technical
        field, and to many non-technical fields as well.</p>

      <h4>I am only in X grade; am I old enough to take this class?</h4>
      <p>If you meet the requirements and are interested in taking this class,
        then age isn't particularly important. To give you an idea of the
        expected age range, though, students in last year's class were all in
        middle school or high school. One of the top students last year was the
        youngest.</p>

      <h4>I am older than the instructor; should I take the class?</h4>
      <p>The same logic as above applies; age shouldn't be an issue. A couple of
        the students last year were older than me, actually.</p>

      <h4>I don't have my own computer; can I take this class?</h4>
      <p>No. You will need to have your own personal computer that meets the
        above requirements to take to every class session, receive and complete
        homework assignments at home, and communicate with me whenever
        necessary.</p>

      <h4>Should I take the spring class?</h4>
      <p>I would only recommend taking the spring class if you plan to take the
        AP® exam.</p>

      <h3>Details</h3>
      <h4>Will you copy me on all communications with my student?</h4>
      <p>Yes, but only if you request that I do so.</p>

      <h4>Where will class sessions take place?</h4>
      <p>All class sessions will take place at our home in Berryville, VA.</p>

      <h4>Will there be an adult present in the classroom?</h4>
      <p>Yes.</p>

      <h4>How long will each class session be?</h4>
      <p>Each class session will be two hours of instruction plus a half-hour
        break in the middle. See the General Information section for the precise
        class schedule.</p>

      <h4>Is this a drop-off class?</h4>
      <p>With the exception of the first session of the fall class and the first
        session of the spring class, parents are welcome to drop off their
        students at this class and pick them up when class is over if a medical
        release form has been filled out for every student being dropped
        off.</p>
      <p>Parents and siblings of students are also welcome to stay at any class
        session to do schoolwork or other activities if they would like;
        however, note that our house is not babyproofed.</p>

      <h4>Why do I need to fill out a medical release form for my student?</h4>
      <p>The medical release form is just a precautionary measure for the very
        unlikely situation in which a student is injured at a class session
        where their parent is not present. Such a situation never occurred last
        year, and because this isn't at all a physically intensive class, we
        don't expect it to happen this year either.</p>

      <h4>What is the weekly workload for this class?</h4>
      <p>Beyond the class sessions themselves, the weekly workload varies. After
        the first few weeks, expect to spend 4+ hours per week outside of class
        on assignments. The final project of the fall class can take about 8-10
        hours and will be assigned over the three-week Christmas break
        period.</p>

      <h4>How is this class scored?</h4>
      <p>The scoring system is percentage-based, with letter grades derived from
        percent grades:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A: 90-100%</li>
        <li>B: 80-89%</li>
        <li>C: 70-79%</li>
        <li>D: 60-69%</li>
        <li>F: &lt;60%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>66% of score is based on homework completion. Each homework assignment
        is worth a different score depending on when it is turned in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3 points: at or before the class session following the session in
          which it is assigned</li>
        <li>2 points: one week late</li>
        <li>1 point: two weeks late or later</li>
        <li>0 points: not turned in at all</li>
      </ul>
      <p>17% of score is based on test results. A student's two lowest test
        scores will be dropped. The percentage of questions answered correctly
        on the remaining tests will be multiplied by 17% and rounded to
        calculate this score fraction.</p>
      <p>17% of score is based on attendance. 1 point is awarded for each class
        session attended.</p>

      <h4>What is the attendance policy for this class?</h4>
      <p>Because of the hands-on subject matter in this class, attendance is
        strongly recommended at all sessions.</p>

      <h4>What is the homework policy for this class?</h4>
      <p>Homework is essential to this class. Each assignment should be
        completed on time if possible so that you can solidify concepts in your
        mind before you move on to other concepts. If you are more than a week
        late on three of your assignments, you will be expelled from the class
        without a refund.</p>

      <h3>AP®</h3>
      <h4>Will I be prepared to take the AP® Computer Science exam after I take
        this class?</h4>
      <p>It's impossible to guarantee anything, but my goal is that any student
        who puts the appropriate effort into both the fall and spring classes
        will be prepared to take the exam. I will do my best to help you achieve
        that goal.</p>

      <h4>Should I take the AP® Computer Science exam?</h4>
      <p>If you plan to study in a technical field (whether or not it's
        programming) in college, you'll probably need to take some sort of
        introductory computer science course. Taking the AP® exam in high school
        can allow you to skip such a course when you get to college (depending
        on which college you go to), which would give you more of an opportunity
        to learn other things that you don't know already. If this applies to
        you, taking the AP® Computer Science exam would be a good choice.</p>

      <h4>When and where is the 2016 AP® Computer Science exam?</h4>
      <p>The exam will take place at 8:00 AM Tuesday, May 3 at whichever
        location you register with to take the exam.</p>

      <h4>How can I find out more about the AP® Computer Science exam?</h4>
      <p>You can find out more about the
        exam <a href="https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a">on
        the CollegeBoard website</a>.</p>

      <h4>Can I get college credit for this class?</h4>
      <p>Maybe, depending on the score you earn on the AP® exam and the college
        you attend.</p>

      <h4>Can I call this class "AP® Computer Science" on my transcript?</h4>
      <p>Yes, you can call this class "AP® Computer Science A" (note the exact
        wording) on your transcript if you complete the fall class.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have been programming since I was about 10 years old, building things
        from calculator apps to basic video games to digital circuit simulators
        in various languages. I took the AP® Computer Science exam in 2013 and
        scored a 5. After that, I finished online courses from Stanford and the
        University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on computer algorithms and
        heterogeneous parallel programming. I have won awards in speech and
        debate competitions at the national level. During the 2014-2015 school
        year, I taught this class to 13 students, and since then, I have been
        continuing to learn new languages and skills to use in building
        programs. I greatly enjoy teaching and sharing my enthusiasm for
        computer programming with others, and I look forward to helping your
        student begin exploring this amazing world of possibilities!</p>
