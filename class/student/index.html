      <h1>2015-2016 AP® CS Class - Student Information</h1>
      <h2>Important</h2>
      <p>You must bring your laptop to every class session unless I specify
        otherwise! You're gonna need it. Also, you must check your email address
        (the one that you gave me on the registration form) <em>at least</em>
        once a day. I will be communicating with you through email quite a lot,
        and it's important that that communication works properly.</p>

      <h2>TeenCoder™ Materials</h2>
      <p>You must bring your TeenCoder™ textbook to the first class session. You
        must also have all digital TeenCoder™ materials on your laptop, which
        you will be bringing to the first class session. For Windows and Mac OS
        X machines, you can simply run the installer. If you are running Linux,
        I will help you set up the TeenCoder™ materials on your laptop in the
        first class session.</p>

      <h2>Software Installation</h2>
      <p>You must have administrator privileges on your computer during and
        outside of class. I will be helping you install programs like compilers,
        runtime environments, integrated development environments, and version
        control systems on your computer, and it is very important that there
        aren't any technical problems while that software is being
        installed.</p>

      <h2>Bitbucket</h2>
      <p>We will be using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> for lab
        assignments in this class. I'll explain what Bitbucket is, why it's
        useful, and how to use it, in the first class session. For now, you just
        need to know that it's a cloud service for storing files, sort of like
        Dropbox.</p>
      <p>The difference between Bitbucket and Dropbox is that Dropbox handles
        things more or less automatically, whereas Bitbucket, which uses the
        version control system <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a>, does
        only what you tell it to do. Git is a whole lot more flexible, durable,
        and scalable than Dropbox, and version control systems are pretty much
        ubiquitous in software development, which is why I'll be teaching you
        how to use it in this course.</p>
      <p>All information you upload to Bitbucket in this class will be private.
        Only you and the people with whom you share it (which will include me,
        of course) will be able to view that information. Bitbucket
        is <em>not</em> in any way a social network; others will not be able to
        contact you through this service. If your parents have any restrictions
        or concerns about creating online accounts, make sure you have their
        approval before you sign up.</p>
      <p>In order to use Bitbucket, you'll first need
        to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/">create an
        account</a>. You will be asked for your name, a username, a password,
        and your email address. <em>The name field is optional, so don't fill it
        out if you don't want to.</em> After you've created an account, you're
        done! There's nothing else you need to do with Bitbucket before class
        starts.</p>
