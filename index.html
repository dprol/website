<h2>2015-2016 AP® Computer Science Class</h2>
<p>Here you can find all of the information you'll need about the AP® Computer
  Science class I will be teaching in the 2015-2016 school year. If you have any
  questions that are not answered here, please <a
  href="mailto:csclass20152016inquiries@gmail.com">email me</a> and I will try
  to answer within 24 hours and update this page if needed.

<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>This is an introductory college-level computer science course which follows
  an AP®-authorized syllabus. Students will learn to write, compile, and run
  programs in <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>.
  Instruction and lab time are provided in weekly on-site sessions and homework
  assignments. <strong>This is not an online class.</strong> The fall course
  teaches fundamental programming concepts, basic and intermediate aspects of
  the Java language, and basic graphical programming, while the spring course
  serves as preparation for the <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science">AP® Computer
  Science</a> exam.
<p>The fall course will start in late August and end in mid-January; the spring
  course will start in late January and end in early May. (Exact dates are yet
  to be determined.) Class will meet once a week; the exact day of week will
  depend on the limits of both my and your schedules.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>You must own and know how to use a laptop computer to take this class. In
  other words, you should be able to easily use a keyboard and mouse to navigate
  through at least the basic menus and features of your operating system. More
  importantly, you should have a firm grasp of your filesystem and be able to
  understand and remember where things are and how to move them around on your
  computer. You must have an email address and check your email frequently (at
  least once a day would be ideal). Knowledge of introductory algebra is
  strongly recommended but not required.
<p>Your computer should at least meet the following minimum requirements:
<ul>
  <li>1.6 GHz CPU
  <li>1024 MB RAM
  <li>1024 x 768 or higher resolution
  <li>Hard drive with 3 GB free space
  <li>DVD-ROM drive
</ul>
<p>The following operating systems are guaranteed to work (or if you use a
  fairly recent version of Linux, that will probably work too):
<ul>
  <li>Windows XP + SP3 or above (except Starter Edition)
  <li>Windows Vista + SP2 or above (except Starter Edition)
  <li>Windows 7
  <li>Windows 8 (except RT)
  <li>OS X 10.5.8 or above (on Intel CPUs)
</ul>
<p>You must have consistent access to the internet to download necessary
  materials and software, receive and submit homework assignments, and otherwise
  communicate with me during the entirety of the course.
<p>At least one parent must attend the first class session in the fall and, if
  applicable, the first class session in the spring. We will give an overview of
  the course and subject matter, answer any remaining questions, and discuss
  important information related to computer science, AP® tests, and of course,
  the AP® Computer Science test, in these two class sessions.

<h3>Price</h3>
<p>The fall class costs $125, and the spring class costs $100. The fall class is
  a prerequisite for the spring class. The price of the fall and spring classes
  together, if paid at the same time before the start of the fall class, is
  $200. All but $50 of total class fees is refundable before the fifth session
  of the fall class.
<p>The fall class uses <a
  href="http://www.homeschoolprogramming.com/teencoder/teencoder_jv_series.php">TeenCoder™</a>
  as a Java textbook. The cost of TeenCoder™ ($75 minimum for the Java
  Programming Complete Course) is not included in other class fees, so you will
  need to purchase it separately. The TeenCoder™ materials are nonconsumable;
  you can use them for any number of students in your family for as long as you
  wish.
<p>The spring class will use an AP® prep book as a study aid. The cost of a prep
  book (~$15) is also not included in other class fees, so you will need to
  purchase one separately. <strong>Do not buy a prep book until after the fall
  class has ended.</strong> Since the AP® Computer Science exam changed its
  format last year, prep book writers still need a chance to catch up, and
  having access to the latest and greatest prep materials is extremely valuable
  for any exam.
<p>The cost of the AP® Computer Science exam is not included in other class
  fees. If you plan to take the exam, you will need to arrange with and pay the
  $91 fee to your local high school.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>Content</h4>
<h5>Will this class teach me to make websites?</h5>
<p>No.

<h5>Will this class teach me to make video games?</h5>
<p>Yes: a graphical board game.

<h5>Why Java?</h5>
<p>While Java isn't the simplest language, it is currently very popular, and the
  way that it emphasizes object-oriented concepts makes it useful for teaching
  those concepts and enforcing best practices. The main reason I recommend
  learning Java first, though, is that it is the language used on the AP®.

<h4>Eligibility</h4>
<h5>Will this class be a good fit for me?</h5>
<p>If you meet the above requirements and you enjoy problem solving, learning
  new things, and experimenting with computers, then yes! Just remember that,
  while there are many reasons this class would be practical for you to take,
  the most important consideration is whether <em>you</em> want to do it.

<h5>Why would I want to take computer science in high school?</h5>
<p>If you plan to study programming in college, starting early will of course
  give you a head start in that field. In addition, taking an introductory
  computer science course in college is considerably more expensive than in high
  school. Even if you don't plan on being a programmer, programming is still
  incredibly relevant to any technical field, and to many non-technical fields
  as well.

<h5>I am only in X grade; am I old enough to take this class?</h5>
<p>If you meet the requirements and are interested in taking this class, then
  age isn't particularly important. To give you an idea of the expected age
  range, though, students in last year's class were all in middle school or high
  school. One of the top students last year was the youngest.

<h5>I am older than the instructor; should I take the class?</h5>
<p>The same logic as above applies; age shouldn't be an issue. A couple of the
  students last year were older than me, actually.

<h5>I don't have my own computer; can I take this class?</h5>
<p>No. You will need to have your own personal computer that meets the above
  requirements to take to every class session, receive and complete homework
  assignments at home, and communicate with me whenever necessary.

<h5>Should I take the spring class?</h5>
<p>I would only recommend taking the spring class if you plan to take the AP®
  exam.

<h4>Details</h4>
<h5>Will you copy me on all communications with my student?</h5>
<p>Yes, but only if you request that I do so.

<h5>Where will class sessions take place?</h5>
<p>All class sessions will take place at our home in Berryville, VA.

<h5>Will there be an adult present in the classroom?</h5>
<p>Yes.

<h5>How long will each class session be?</h5>
<p>Each class session will be two hours of instruction plus a half-hour break in
  the middle. The exact day of week and time of day are yet to be determined,
  but we expect that they will be similar to last year: 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM on
  Wednesdays.

<h5>What is the weekly workload for this class?</h5>
<p>Beyond the class sessions themselves, the weekly workload varies. After the
  first few weeks, expect to spend 4+ hours per week outside of class on
  assignments. The final project of the fall class can take about 8-10 hours and
  will be assigned over the three-week Christmas break period.

<h5>How is this class scored?</h5>
<p>The scoring system is percentage-based, with letter grades derived from
  percent grades:
<ul>
  <li>A: 90-100%
  <li>B: 80-89%
  <li>C: 70-79%
  <li>D: 60-69%
  <li>F: &lt;60%
</ul>
<p>66% of score is based on homework completion. Each homework assignment is
  worth a different score depending on when it is turned in:
<ul>
  <li>3 points: at or before the class session following the session in which it
    is assigned
  <li>2 points: one week late
  <li>1 point: two weeks late or later
  <li>0 points: not turned in at all
</ul>
<p>17% of score is based on test results. A student's two lowest test scores
  will be dropped. The percentage of questions answered correctly on the
  remaining tests will be multiplied by 17% and rounded to calculate this score
  fraction.
<p>17% of score is based on attendance. 1 point is awarded for each class
  session attended.

<h5>What is the attendance policy for this class?</h5>
<p>Because of the hands-on subject matter in this class, attendance is strongly
  recommended at all sessions.

<h5>What is the homework policy for this class?</h5>
<p>Homework is essential to this class. Each assignment should be completed on
  time if possible so that you can solidify concepts in your mind before you
  move on to other concepts. If you are more than a week late on three of your
  assignments, you will be expelled from the class without a refund.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I have been programming since I was about 10 years old, building things from
  calculator apps to basic video games to digital circuit simulators in various
  languages. I took the AP® Computer Science exam in 2013 and scored a 5. After
  that, I finished online courses from Stanford and the University of Illinois
  at Urbana-Champaign on computer algorithms and heterogeneous parallel
  programming. I have won awards in speech and debate competitions at the
  national level. During the 2014-2015 school year, I taught this class to 13
  students, and since then, I have been continuing to learn new languages and
  skills to use in building programs. I greatly enjoy teaching and sharing my
  enthusiasm for computer programming with others, and I look forward to helping
  your student begin exploring this amazing world of possibilities!
