<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>This is an introductory college-level computer science course which follows
  an AP®-authorized syllabus. Students will learn to write, compile, and run
  programs in <a

  Instruction and lab time are provided in weekly on-site sessions and homework
  assignments. <strong>This is not an online class.</strong> The fall course
  teaches fundamental programming concepts, basic and intermediate aspects of
  the Java language, and basic graphical programming, while the spring course
  serves as preparation for the <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science">AP® Computer
  Science</a> exam.
<p>The fall course will start in late August and end in mid-January; the spring
  course will start in late January and end in early May. (Exact dates are yet
  to be determined.) Class will meet once a week; the exact day of week will
  depend on the limits of both my and your schedules.
