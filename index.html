<h2>2015-2016 AP® Computer Science Class</h2>
<p>Here you can find all of the information you'll need about the AP® Computer
  Science class I will be teaching in the 2015-2016 school year. If you have any
  questions that are not answered here, please <a
  href="mailto:csclass20152016inquiries@gmail.com">email me</a> and I will try
  to answer within 24 hours and update this page if needed.

<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>This is an introductory college-level computer science course which follows
  an AP®-authorized syllabus. Students will learn to write, compile, and run
  programs in <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>.
  Instruction and lab time are provided in weekly on-site sessions and homework
  assignments. <strong>This is not an online class.</strong> The fall course
  teaches fundamental programming concepts, basic and intermediate aspects of
  the Java language, and basic graphical programming, while the spring course
  serves as preparation for the <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science">AP® Computer
  Science</a> exam.
<p>The fall course will start in late August and end in mid-January; the spring
  course will start in late January and end in early May. (Exact dates are yet
  to be determined.) Class will meet once a week; the exact day of week will
  depend on the limits of both my and your schedules.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>You must own and know how to use a computer to take this class. In other
  words, you should be able to easily use a keyboard and mouse to navigate
  through at least the basic menus and features of your operating system. More
  importantly, you should have a firm grasp of your filesystem and be able to
  understand and remember where things are and how to move them around on your
  computer.
<p>Your computer should at least meet the following minimum requirements:
<ul>
  <li>1.6 GHz CPU
  <li>1024 MB RAM
  <li>1024 x 768 or higher resolution
  <li>Hard drive with 3 GB free space
  <li>DVD-ROM drive
</ul>
<p>The following operating systems are guaranteed to work (or if you use a
  fairly recent version of Linux, that will probably work too):
<ul>
  <li>Windows XP + SP3 or above (except Starter Edition)
  <li>Windows Vista + SP2 or above (except Starter Edition)
  <li>Windows 7
  <li>Windows 8 (except RT)
  <li>OS X 10.5.8 or above (on Intel CPUs)
</ul>
<p>You must have consistent access to the internet to download necessary
  materials and software, receive and submit homework assignments, and otherwise
  communicate with me during the entirety of the course.
