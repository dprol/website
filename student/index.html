<h2>2015-2016 AP® Computer Science Class - Student Information</h2>
<p>Very important: you must bring your laptop to every class session unless I
  specify otherwise! You're gonna need it.

<h3>TeenCoder™ Materials</h3>
<p>You must bring your TeenCoder™ textbook to the first class session. You must
  also have all digital TeenCoder™ materials on your laptop, which you will be
  bringing to the first class session. For Windows and Mac OS X machines, you
  can simply run the installer. If you are running Linux, I will help you set up
  the TeenCoder™ materials on your laptop in the first class session.

<h3>Software Installation</h3>
<p>You must have administrator privileges on your computer during and outside of
  class. I will be helping you install programs like compilers, runtime
  environments, integrated development environments, and version control systems
  on your computer, and it is very important that there aren't any technical
  problems while that software is being installed.

<h3>Bitbucket</h3>
<p>We will be using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> for lab
  assignments in this class. I'll explain what Bitbucket is, why it's useful,
  and how to use it, in the first class session, but it's basically a cloud
  service for storing files, sort of like Dropbox.
<p>The difference between Bitbucket and Dropbox is that Dropbox handles things
  more or less automatically, whereas Bitbucket, which uses the version control
  system <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a>, does only what you tell it
  to do. Git is a whole lot more flexible, durable, and scalable than Dropbox,
  and version control systems are pretty much ubiquitous in software
  development, which is why I'll be teaching you how to use it in this course.
<p>All information you upload to Bitbucket in this class will be private. Only
  you and the people with whom you share it (which will include me, of course)
  will be able to view that information. If your parents have any restrictions
  or concerns about creating online accounts, make sure you have their approval
  before you sign up.
<p>In order to use Bitbucket, you'll first need to <a
  href="https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/">create an account</a>. You will
  be asked for your name, a username, a password, and your email address.
  <em>The name field is optional, so don't fill it out if you don't want
  to.</em> After you've created an account, you're done! There's nothing else
  you need to do with Bitbucket before class starts.
