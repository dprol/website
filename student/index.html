<h3>TeenCoder™ Materials</h3>
<p>You must bring your TeenCoder™ textbook to the first class session. You must
  also have all digital TeenCoder™ materials on your laptop, which you will be
  bringing to the first class session. For Windows and OS X machines, you can
  simply run the installer; the exception to this rule is for Linux machines. If
  you are running Linux, I will help you set up the TeenCoder™ materials on your
  laptop in the first class session.

<h3>Software Installation</h3>
<p>You must have administrator privileges on your computer during and outside of
  class. I will be helping you install programs like compilers, runtime
  environments, integrated development environments, and version control systems
  on your computer, and it is very important that there aren't any technical
  problems while that software is being installed.
