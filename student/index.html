<h3>TeenCoder™ Materials</h3>
<p>You must bring your TeenCoder™ textbook to the first class session. You must
  also have all digital TeenCoder™ materials on your laptop, which you will be
  bringing to the first class session. For Windows and OS X machines, you can
  simply run the installer; the exception to this rule is for Linux machines. If
  you are running Linux, I will help you set up the TeenCoder™ materials on your
  laptop in the first class session.
