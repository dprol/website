<h3>Carpooling</h3>
<p>Flexibility is important in any sort of long-term commitment, and this class
  is no exception. In order to help you work out logistics for getting to class
  and back, I have put together a class roster with location and contact
  information for those who have given me permission to do so.
<p>You can use this roster to communicate and arrange carpooling with other
  families at your convenience. However, the requirement that at least one
  parent must attend the first session in the fall class and, if applicable, the
  first session in the spring class, still holds.
