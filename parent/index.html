<h3>Carpooling</h3>
<p>Flexibility is important in any sort of long-term commitment, and this class
  is no exception. In order to help you work out logistics for getting to class
  and back, I have put together a class roster with location and contact
  information for those who have given me permission to do so.
<p>You can use this roster to communicate and arrange carpooling with other
  families at your convenience. However, the requirement that at least one
  parent must attend the first session in the fall class and, if applicable, the
  first session in the spring class, still holds.

<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>As stated on the registration form, you must make full payment for the fall
  class by Tuesday, August 11, 2015. The address to which payment must be made
  is listed in the confirmation email you received after you filled out the
  registration form.
<p>If your student is taking both the fall and spring classes, you can choose
  whether you would like to pay the $200 bundle price now for both classes, or
  instead pay just the $125 for the fall class now, and pay the $100 for the
  spring class before its first session in mid-January.

<h3>TeenCoder™ Purchase</h3>
<p>For the first class session on August 18, you will need to bring your laptop
  and all of your TeenCoder™ materials (physical textbook if applicable, plus
  all digital materials). Therefore, you must purchase TeenCoder™ as soon as
  possible so that you will have those materials before class starts. You can
  purchse TeenCoder™ <a
  href="http://www.homeschoolprogramming.com/teencoder/teencoder_jv_series.php">here</a>.
<p>Since it contains exactly the TeenCoder™ materials we will need in this
  class, I would strongly recommend purchasing hte TeenCoder™: Java Programming
  Complete Course bundle, which is $75 and can be found between The Year Pack
  and TeenCoder™: Android Programming bundles on the page I've linked. If you
  would like, however, you can purchase a different bundle, but the bundle that
  you purchase must at least include the TeenCoder™: Java Programming Complete
  Course materials.
