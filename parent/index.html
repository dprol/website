<h3>Carpooling</h3>
<p>Flexibility is important in any sort of long-term commitment, and this class
  is no exception. In order to help you work out logistics for getting to class
  and back, I have put together a class roster with location and contact
  information for those who have given me permission to do so.
<p>You can use this roster to communicate and arrange carpooling with other
  families at your convenience. However, the requirement that at least one
  parent must attend the first session in the fall class and, if applicable, the
  first session in the spring class, still holds.

<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>As stated on the registration form, you must make full payment for the fall
  class by Tuesday, August 11, 2015. The address to which payment must be made
  is listed in the confirmation email you received after you filled out the
  registration form.
<p>If your student is taking both the fall and spring classes, you can choose
  whether you would like to pay the $200 bundle price now for both classes, or
  instead pay just the $125 for the fall class now, and pay the $100 for the
  spring class before its first session in mid-January.
