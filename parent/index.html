<h2>2015-2016 AP® Computer Science Class - Parent Information</h2>
<p>Quick note: both the class roster and the snack signup sheet are Google
  spreadsheets, so you'll need a Google account to access them. All the
  students' moms have been given permission to view the spreadsheets; if you
  need permission on another account as well, please email me and I'll add that
  account to the spreadsheet.

<h3>Carpooling</h3>
<p>Flexibility is important in any sort of long-term commitment, and this class
  is no exception. In order to help you work out logistics for getting to class
  and back, I have put together a <a
  href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ryx31vbb3UjFgUN9D8xOLKTCyfANpe5Az8Xkz0tZ9ro/edit?usp=sharing">class
  roster</a> with location and contact information for those who have given me
  permission to do so.
<p>You can use this roster to communicate and arrange carpooling with other
  families at your convenience. However, the requirement that at least one
  parent must attend the first session in the fall class and, if applicable, the
  first session in the spring class, still holds.

<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>As stated on the registration form, you must make full payment for the fall
  class by Tuesday, August 11, 2015. The address to which payment must be made
  is listed in the confirmation email you received after you filled out the
  registration form.
<p>If your student is taking both the fall and spring classes, you can choose
  whether you would like to pay the $200 bundle price now for both classes, or
  instead pay just the $125 for the fall class now, and pay the $100 for the
  spring class before its first session in mid-January.

<h3>TeenCoder™ Purchase</h3>
<p>For the first class session on August 18, your student will need to bring
  their laptop and all of their TeenCoder™ materials (physical textbook, plus
  all digital materials). Therefore, you must purchase TeenCoder™ as soon as
  possible so that you will have those materials before class starts. You can
  purchase TeenCoder™ <a
  href="http://www.homeschoolprogramming.com/teencoder/teencoder_jv_series.php">here</a>.
<p>Since it contains exactly the TeenCoder™ materials we will need in this
  class, I would strongly recommend purchasing the TeenCoder™: Java Programming
  Complete Course bundle, which is $75 and can be found between The Year Pack
  and TeenCoder™: Android Programming bundles on the page I've linked. If you
  would like, however, you can purchase a different bundle, but the bundle that
  you purchase must at least include the TeenCoder™: Java Programming Complete
  Course materials.

<h3>Snacks</h3>
<p>Programmers need their snacks! We'd like to ask each family to bring snacks
  three times during the fall semester. More detailed information is available
  on the <a
  href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WumxeNR-aYakmDFv0wjxHFMntZrrUf19UrDqONuDHlk/edit?usp=sharing">snack
  signup sheet</a>.
<p>Plan to bring snacks for at least 10 people. Nothing really fancy is
  necessary; a simple snack is perfectly fine. What exactly you bring is up to
  you, but there are some snack ideas on the spreadsheet just in case.

<h3>Medical Release Form</h3>
<p>Unless you plan to stay with your student, please be sure to bring a
  completed medical release form to the first class session if you have not
  already sent it to me.

<h3>Inclement Weather</h3>
<p>Please make an effort to attend every class session and to arrive a few
  minutes early so that instruction can begin promptly at 9:00 AM. If we have
  inclement weather, we will cancel by email by 7:00 AM that day and try to make
  the class up later in the week if possible. If a class is canceled and cannot
  be made up, we will electronically provide you with the slides and homework
  assignments for that week. Even if class is cancelled, due dates for homework
  assignments do not change.
<p>If it snows, but we decide not to cancel class, there are a couple things to
  keep in mind about parking in our driveway. Only the paved part of the
  driveway will be plowed, so driving around during drop-off or pick-up may be
  tight. Finally, be sure not to drive or park near the roof if snow is on it;
  because of the solar panels, there is a very real hazard of snow sliding off
  and damaging your car or hurting someone.
